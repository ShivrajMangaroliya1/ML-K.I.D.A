K.I.D.A - Kinetic motion Insects  Detection Algorithm

In the realm of modern agriculture, the emphasis on sustainable and environmentally friendly practices has given rise to biocontrol companies dedicated to enhancing plant growth while minimizing the ecological impact.  However, a critical challenge faced by biocontrol company is the manual counting of predatory mites in each batch destined for sale. The existing method, reliant on visual inspection through microscopes, is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors, dependent on the individual skills of the person behind the microscope. Recognizing the significance of this bottleneck, there is a compelling need for a technological solution that can transform this operational aspect.

The proposed solution involves the development and implementation of a sophisticated object detection software. This software, leveraging machine learning algorithms, aims to accurately and efficiently count the number of predator and feeder mites within each sample. The microscopic nature of these mites necessitates the use of a microscope attached to a camera, with the current technology in place being the Dino-lite system. The primary objective is to streamline production processes, enhance quality assessments, and mitigate the risks associated with human error in mite counting. This project envisions the development of a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy adoption of the software, ensuring that its benefits extend beyond the technical team within the biocontrol company. In essence, the development of this software represents a pivotal step forward for the biocontrol industry, offering not only increased efficiency and accuracy in production but also empowering end-users with the tools to validate the quality of biocontrol products.
